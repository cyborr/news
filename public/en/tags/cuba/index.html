At first, the local newspaper Sierra Maestra reported that five homes had been affected, but the Cuban News Agency (ACN) raised the figure to &ldquo;nine rooms in a citadel&rdquo;, thereby trying to reduce the magnitude of a disaster that left several families with nothing.

At the end of the hearing, the mother of the young man imprisoned for more than a year did not want to speak to the press, as she was very overwhelmed and crying when leaving the Municipal People&rsquo;s Court of Marianao, as our journalist was able to verify on the spot.

      cubanoticias.crypto   The use of new technologies has raised new forms of struggle against the Cuban Communist Dictatorship. It spreads like a cancer throughout the democratic countries of the world.
Platforms such as blogger, twitter, facebook, youtube and other social networks have become ideological battlefields in which communists try to penetrate societies while subverting their order. The documented penetration of Cuban intelligence organizations in the countries of the region and in the educational centers of the world make it necessary to denounce by all possible means the danger that communism represents for the world.
