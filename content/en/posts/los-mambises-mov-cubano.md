Los Mambises is the name of a peaceful civic struggle movement, created this December with the purpose of boycotting the Cuban regime's businesses from social networks.

Its founder is Cuban activist based in Canada, Alberto Fonseca, who earlier this month protested, together with a friend, over the sale of Cubita coffee in stores in the city of Vancouver, a product associated with the state company CIMEX and the GAESA military conglomerate.

After several exchanges with the owners of the London Drugs chain, Fonseca managed to have the coffee removed from its facilities, albeit temporarily, as their manager informed him that they would put new containers on the shelves, this time without the stamp of the company. Cuban institution, which no longer markets it internationally.

Alberto Fonseca is the brother of Roberto Pérez Fonseca, a political prisoner on the island for participating in the mass protests of 11J. In his Twitter account, he affirmed that his activism, from exile, is also in favor of the freedom of all Cubans arrested for opposing the Castro dictatorship.

Inspired by his first approach, Fonseca created Los Mambises and began an Internet boycott against the regime's hotels. The first fruits of his work were reflected in the negative opinions that are currently circulating on the networks regarding the exclusive Paseo del Prado hotel, inaugurated by Raúl Castro in 2019 and belonging to the Gaviota military corporation.

The facility, located in Havana, had a Google score of 4.8 and thanks to the action of this new movement, it dropped to 2.8 stars, based on the publication of negative reviews on different tourist recommendation platforms.

The Prime Minister of Cuba, Manuel Marrero Cruz, reacted indignantly to the boycott during the IV Ibero-American Summit on Accessible Tourism, which was held at the Hotel Nacional. In that space, the official affirmed that the media campaign is orchestrated and financed from the United States, to stop the recent opening of the Greater Antilles to international tourism.

In this social network, he shared a video where he announced the emergence of the group, its peaceful nature and a call to action, to achieve real damage to the regime's businesses abroad. He also stated that one of his most important activities would be to curb the support that the Paris Club offers to the government of the island. That organization recently forgave a debt of $ 8.5 billion to the country's authorities.

For every one million inmate, it is one of the slogans of the group that in the next few days will be making known to some of its members, its most immediate purposes and ideas to fight the dictatorship, starting by stopping its business with foreign private companies.
