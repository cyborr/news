The trial of Cuban political prisoner Luis Robles, held on Thursday in Havana, was concluded for sentencing, according to DIARIO DE CUBA. The Prosecutor's Office requests a joint penalty of six years in prison for the alleged crimes of "enemy propaganda and resistance."

At the end of the hearing, the mother of the young man imprisoned for more than a year did not want to speak to the press, as she was very overwhelmed and crying when leaving the Municipal People's Court of Marianao, as our journalist was able to verify on the spot.

"They had hope from his lawyer, who told them that Robles had not done anything, that they had to release him," said our reporter.

Later, Landy Fernández, the brother of the political prisoner, said that his mother had told him that Luis "remains firm in his ideals and that he really liked the work the lawyer did."

Robles has been imprisoned since on December 4, 2020, he stood on the Boulevard de San Rafael, in Centro Habana, with a poster calling for the end of the repression and the release of rebellious rapper Denis Solís, a member of the San Isidro Movement. , currently out of the country.

The trial against him was scheduled for July 16 at the Diez de Octubre Municipal People's Court, but was suspended until this date as a result of the peaceful protests that broke out on the 11th of the same month.

According to the regime's repressive script, theirs should be another process that criminalizes the political conduct of the people and punishes dissent with prison.

Shortly, the regime would make the punishment final for the young man, who has already served one of the six years in prison that the Prosecutor's Office requests for him. During that time, he has suffered mistreatment, physical and psychological torture and humiliation in the maximum security prison of Combinado del Este, in the Cuban capital.

In October, the United Nations Human Rights Council's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Robles' arrest and imprisonment qualifies as arbitrary detention.

In the video of the arrest that circulated on social networks, it can be clearly seen that Robles did not resist the arrest at any time. The support of the Cubans present for his attitude can also be clearly seen.

This support, however, did not prevent his arrest. Robles was led to a patrol car. No policeman pushed him, because he did not resist. And that is the last image that exists of him, riding in a patrol car in front of the Capitol in Havana.

According to the analysis of lawyers familiar with the judicial system of the regime consulted by DIARIO DE CUBA, the criminal proceeding against Luis Robles pointed from the beginning to a political strategy of dissuasion.

However, the strategy has been a failure, in light of the historic protests of 11J. The detainees and criminally prosecuted after the repressive wave of that and subsequent days today suffer firsthand the lesson that the regime first wanted to give the young Robles.
