"Everything is very expensive. I left the airport and on Ocho Vías, I was hungry, I stopped to eat something, one of these boxes that used to sell between 25, 30 or 50 pesos ... Well, the boxes are now about 270 pesos, almost 300 and they are two tablespoons of congrí, a rotten sweet potato and a rotten meat. Disgusting, "said a Cuban visiting the island to DIARIO DE CUBA.

The young man, who prefers anonymity, will spend just two weeks on the Island and has not visited the country since before the Covid-19 pandemic and the so-called Ordering Task began. He will return to Spain and will not have to deal, like other Cubans, with the high prices that complicate this end of the year.

"A small bottle of soda costs 200 pesos. Everything (soft drinks, beers ...) is worth more than 150 pesos. The money has lost value. A tiny package of Pelly, 70 pesos. Maria cookies, the basic ones that cost one euro and peak in Spain, 1,000 pesos in individuals, 1,000 pesos. A horror! ", he added.

Yusmany Reyes does live in Havana and told a Facebook group that his father asked him "'what will we eat and what will we drink for Christmas and the end of the year?' In order not to hurt his self-esteem, his dignity, I limited myself to hiding it, I don't even remember what I answered, but that has been going round and round in my head ".

"I am 50 years old, I did not live before the Revolution, if my parents, uncles, grandparents, I heard from them many times that for Christmas Eve and the end of the year, no one in Cuba, not even they who were poor, would go to bed without eating, whether it was turkey, the traditional roast pork, sweets like nougat and even homemade ones like orange shells, "he said.

"This year in Cuba very few will celebrate one or another date, the most disorderly order in universal history, it will not allow it, the scarcity, the high prices (...) the economic disaster in which my country is submerged, miseries, calamities , laments, criticism and much indignation has left a process that, far from ordering, organizing, fixing, overcoming and solving, has increased and multiplied our problems, plunging us into a state that goes from the ironic, to the ridiculous and stupid, "he said. .

"No dad, this year we will not eat pork, or turkey, or fish, or sheep, even chicken, not even thinking about beef. Perhaps, if we behave well, they will give us mincemeat, that, accompanied with a homemade wine, or a An invention of those drinks that Cuban ingenuity prepares. Damn, all our traditions have killed us, the desires, the desires. This year I will not throw water, nor will I go around the block, I will not visit anyone, because my problems are also yours, you will be just like me, calm, waiting, waiting, waiting, "added Reyes.

For his part, a user identified as Hitman on Twitter said that "whoever wonders why there is no pig by the end of the year, the answer is simple: the regime wants dollars and through FINCIMEX and Copextel they sell it in dollars for the worms in the Bazaar Gift. Gold-plated pigs for the prices they have. "

In Bazar Regalo they sell whole pigs, between 40 and 50 kilograms, for more than 300 dollars to deliver in Cuba. In the case of pigs between 25 and 30 kg, the price is 240 or 246 dollars.

Meanwhile, Osvaldo Surí González, program coordinator for the Cienfuegos provincial government, said that "raw pork in quantities and pounds cannot be sold anywhere because it does not exist in the province."

In Havana, resellers sell a sealed case of Bucanero beer for up to 40 MLC (freely convertible currency or dollars), Leo Leo told a food delivery group in the capital.

"This country has people crazy. My God, something is already sold in MLC that in stores is also at 1.30," said Odalys Castillo. "In the stores in MLC each beer costs 1.30, that is, 31.2 you want to get almost 9 pesos from them, they are crazy, very crazy," added Celianny Quiñones.
