Cuban political prisoner Andy García Lorenzo has been punished with two months without telephone communication and threatened by the political police with adding one more charge to his file if he continues to collaborate with an initiative of his family to help other detainees with food after the historic protests July 11.

"The last thing we have is that they sanctioned my brother Andy Dunier García Lorenzo to two months without phone calls for giving me information about prisoners for us, through the project 'Help the Brave of 11J' to help them with the bags" said Roxana García Lorenzo, the detainee's sister, in a press group.

The young woman recalled that her brother is now in the Guamajal maximum security prison in Santa Clara, where "are the people who have already been tried."

"There he is receiving threats that if he continues to help the prisoners, the crime of 'instigation to commit a crime' will be added to his prosecutor's request and that he will be tried for what we, his family, do out here," he added Roxana Garcia.

According to her statements, "they threaten everyone around him not to approach him and try to keep him isolated from the rest of the prisoners."

However, Andy García Lorenzo "continues firm and willing to go over everything, but never negotiate with State Security; this option, under no circumstances," said the young woman.

"He knows the reason why he is still imprisoned and he remains more firm than ever, firm in the cause and fighting in some way so that Cuba can be free," she concluded.

Andy García has been charged with the crimes of "public disorder" and "contempt" for demonstrating peacefully on July 11. The Prosecutor's Office asks for seven years in prison for him.

According to the legal advice Cubalex, in Villa Clara 90 people were detained as a result of the 11J protests. According to the latest data published by the Justicia 11J group, of a total of 1,314 people detained throughout the island, at least 696 remain in detention centers. Of the 570 people who have been released, many are awaiting trial under a precautionary measure of bail or house arrest. A total of 140 people face charges of sedition.
