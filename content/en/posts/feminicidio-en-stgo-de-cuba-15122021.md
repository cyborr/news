Rosangela Vargas Noaya is the name of another victim of gender violence in Cuba. The 24-year-old woman was stabbed by her ex-partner in the Los Hoyos neighborhood, Santiago de Cuba province, on December 6.

The young woman, who was pregnant, also left an eight-year-old daughter who must suffer the loss of her and continue to grow in a society that has normalized attacks of this type.

According to sources close to the family confirmed to Diario de Cuba, Vargas Noaya died at the scene of the attack due to the severity of the injuries, apparently caused with a knife.

Her murderer traveled from Matanzas, where she resided, to put an end to her life. Although no details are known about the case, the couple had ended their relationship a few months ago, but once again the machismo and sense of "property" that the patriarchy imposes in Cuba culminated in a femicide.

The independent civil organization Mujeres Esperanza, based in Santiago de Cuba, shared on its Twitter account images of the moment when the body was transported to the Santa Ifigenia cemetery, where it was buried.

On December 8, the death of a mother of three children at the hands of her partner was also known. The Observatorio de Alas Tensas confirmed on its Facebook page the identity of the victim: Yordanka, around 40 years old and a neighbor of the Ciudamar neighborhood, in San Miguel del Padrón.

Likewise, it demanded that the Federation of Cuban Women (FMC) deal with "this silent pandemic that is more than two years old" and that in 2021 has claimed the lives of around thirty women.

“Where are the shelters for battered women? When will femicide be classified within the Cuban penal code? ”, Questioned the organization. "How many Cubans must be killed for it to be understood that this is an emergency situation, that it has structural causes in the patriarchal system that governs Cuba?"

While this is happening, the FMC and other institutions that claim to protect women dismiss the need to approve a Comprehensive Law against Gender Violence and are not able to call a sexual offender by name.
