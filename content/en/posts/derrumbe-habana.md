This Thursday at least two people were injured in a collapse that occurred in Old Havana, as confirmed by the Provincial Government of People's Power of the Cuban capital.

At 9:10 p.m. A wall of a building located on Angeles Street, Monte corner, in the Jesús María Popular Council collapsed. In a note published by the official website Cubadebate, it is reported that two passers-by were trapped when one side of the second level of the construction collapsed.

One of the victims was immediately transferred "to the nearest hospital," says the text without offering details of her state of health. However, she could be seriously injured as several videos released on social networks show a person trapped in the rubble with a large head injury and unconscious.

The transport was diverted from the area where the collapse occurred to facilitate rescue actions, as well as the subsequent evaluations of the place. At the end of the note "the firefighters and the personnel who came to support continue working to rescue the other passerby."

Although the ruling party has not reported victims, the independent journalist Héctor Luis Valdés Cocho spoke with neighbors in the area and they told him that "so far there have been four deaths, including a minor."

Walking through the streets of Old Havana has not been safe for a long time, even many do not dare to do it on the sidewalks for fear that a balcony will fall on them. Unfortunately, many people have died in this way or have been seriously injured; The Cuban capital is falling apart and the situation seems to have no reversal in a city where the government only makes small “patches” to calm the spirits.

In January 2020, Cuba was shocked by the death of three girls on Águila and Revillagigedo streets when a balcony collapsed on them. One of the minors died immediately and the other two shortly after in a hospital.

Neighbors of Jesús María blamed the government for authorizing the demolition of the building from the rear and the area was not fenced. However, as is usual when the blame falls on the authorities, the event did not transcend beyond the irreparable pain of the girls' family.

“They were rehearsing in the park to parade in an act for (the anniversary of the birth of) José Martí. One of them bought an ice cream on the corner and the three of them sat there, and the entire wall fell on top of them, "explained Esther, a neighbor on the same street saw the events, according to the newspaper La Vanguardia.

Fundamentally, in the municipalities of Centro Habana, Old Havana, Cerro and Diez Octubre, dozens of families sleep in fear that their homes will collapse from one moment to the next, without hope of acquiring a new one or the State will take action on the matter.

So far, neither the company nor the regime authorities have clarified why the service was cut, although ETECSA indicated that measures are already being worked on to resolve it.
