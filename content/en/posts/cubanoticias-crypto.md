The use of new technologies has raised new forms of struggle against the Cuban Communist Dictatorship. It spreads like a cancer throughout the democratic countries of the world.

Platforms such as blogger, twitter, facebook, youtube and other social networks have become ideological battlefields in which communists try to penetrate societies while subverting their order. The documented penetration of Cuban intelligence organizations in the countries of the region and in the educational centers of the world make it necessary to denounce by all possible means the danger that communism represents for the world.

Web 3.0 and the blockchain advance to become a means of freedom of both expression and personal. Today, through the use of IPFS, Blockchain and decentralized platforms, we intend to recover through free information the spaces that communist dictatorships have snatched around the world.

Faced with this threat and the reality that totalitarian regimes such as the Cuban one try to hijack information channels through blockades, censorship and service cuts, which forces users to use third-party applications (VPN) in order to stay informed which at the same time are blocked by the censorship methods of the dictatorship through coercion, intimidation, threats we have created this news blog through the use of Blockchain technology that cannot be censored or blocked in any of the countries that maintain these types of totalitarian regimes.

To access the website, you can use the traditional website https://cubanoticias.info or through the Blockchain domain cubanoticias.crypto which cannot be censored.

<h3> How to access cubanoticias.crypto? </h3>

To access cubanoticias.crypto you can do so through Brave Browser, Opera browser, Unstoppable Browser from any mobile device or using the Chrome, Brave Browser, Firefox browsers through any computer using the corresponding plugins for each browser.

<h3> What are the benefits of using blockchain domains over traditional domains? </h3>

For users, being able to access the news from anywhere they are without being censored is the main benefit. For platforms, it is to have an option in which they can reach a greater number of users in countries under totalitarian regimes with information that will remain unchanged in the block network.

<h3> Our goal </h3>

Our goal is to help spread the reality of what is happening inside Cuba not only for people who live outside the island but also for those who do not have ways to stay informed or remain only with the version of the dictatorship.

Here you can find News of interest, Complaints, Human Rights Violations, compendiums of other sites that are censored on the Island and news from all parts of the Island.

We intend to be a reliable source of information that can be remembered when other alternative sources are not available, as well as combat misinformation in the official media.

Cubanoticias.crypto is the evolution of the RedxCuba.org project now on the blockchain.
