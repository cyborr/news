Havana Cuba. – The man who appears in the video had crossed barefoot and in a hurry the roundabout of the Virgen del Camino. Limping, holding his embossed shorts in churre with one hand and holding with the other a nylon jabot that looked as if it had been taken from a garbage can, he slipped into the agro. He went directly to the warehouse where everything that is not suitable for sale is accumulated; which is saying a lot, because the sellers try to sell even merchandise in obvious bad condition, with a bad smell, good for pigs.

That's as far as the subject went, with the unmistakable appearance of alcoholics on the streets. He reached into a fly-filled box, pulled out a half-rotten piece of bombafruit, and strode away through the crowds at the bus lines and stops. Right there, on the sidewalk, he dropped the fruit. Holding tightly to the shorts so as not to be left naked in the middle of the street, he began to devour her.

His was a hunger of centuries, something hard to see. That man would have eaten anything put in front of him. People looked at him without interest, with contempt or disgust.

What is seen in the video is not an isolated case. Every day there are more of them in Havana, lying everywhere, sick, dirty, covered by their own waste. The family, if they have it, does not take charge. The state is not responsible. The rest simply want them to disappear because they make an already gray environment ugly.


Nobody gives alms to drunkards. They eat what they find in the garbage, rarely drink water and drop half dead in any doorway. They are not given medical attention; If someone collapses and the police are notified, the officer approaches and pushes him a little with his boot, to see if he reacts. Touch him? For nothing in the world. Put him on patrol? Much less, because then they would have to clean it themselves. Call an ambulance? Better to let him die in the sweet peace of hypoglycemic shock.

When the journalist Jorge Ramos confronted Maduro, telling him that Venezuelans were eating out of the garbage, the dictator became upset and ordered the confiscation of his laptop containing the videos proving the famine caused by Chavismo.

This, the one in the video, is the famine caused by the Cuban Revolution, which today has escalated to a level higher than that of the Special Period. No floor blanket steak because there aren't even any blankets to begin with. There are also no condom pizzas for the same reason.

But a man has already been seen skinning a cat to eat it, another cooking an African snail and only God knows what they grind in that minced meat that they give to the population and where a user found, a few days ago, a complete set of unidentified origin.

**The regime can invent what it wants, go on tour to beg for what it can and brazenly affirm that more than five million islanders went to the polls this Sunday to prolong the reality that can be seen in this video, which says a lot about our society.**
