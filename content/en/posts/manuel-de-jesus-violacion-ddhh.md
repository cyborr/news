It's been six months since my cousin. <b> Manuel de Jesús Rojas Miranda </b>, was kidnapped by State Security.

Prior to this event, he had been given a year without detention, for the Crime of <b> Pre-criminal Social Danger </b> (an invention that only exists in Cuba, used by the Dictatorship, to remove those who are annoying ). When there were two months to comply with this arbitrary sanction, they decided to kidnap him. Reason? Do not accept to become a Chivato (Toad).

For a long time he had been harassed by a Security agent named Esmol, with the complicity of the Guaro Police, the Mayarí Court, and the prosecution, who, because they were at the service of the Dictatorship, did not play the role that It corresponded to the complaint that the family presented to this entity.

On the day of the kidnapping, he was intercepted in the middle of the street, and placed in a Police Patrol.

During all this time, he has been tortured both physically and psychically, he fell ill with Covid-19 while in prison and his executioners were able to keep him locked up, alone, for several days without giving him food. They took him out of that hole, because he had a fever.

In the month of November they released him, but he was not even ten days in the street and he was kidnapped for the second time before November 15, this time, they raided his home at 5.30 AM, as cowards do, still from night, so that the people do not see the infamies they commit.

At the moment he is in the Playa Manteca prison, Mayarí municipality, sick and without medical attention, after having spent several days sleeping on the dirty and cold floor of the prison, without a mattress, much less a bed. As a consequence of this, he has a body full of betas that turned red from white, and he also suffers from stomach disorders. Presumably, he is full of parasites, acquired in the filthy apartment where he was forced to sleep for so many days.

Now the rogue mob tells the family that they must bring the drugs.

And to think that there are still fools who see this horror movie that Cubans live, as something normal.

A country where there is nothing, where people do not have food, where so many die for lack of medical resources, where there is no transportation, where you can only see Destruction, Misery and Repression. While the Dictator and all the leadership that he misgoverns live as if they were the kings of the country.

For this reason, Cubans must unite, and build the bases of a Democratic Government that truly responds to the interests of the people. A government that replaces the Mafia of millionaires, who believe they are owners of Cuba.

We want a Homeland as Martí dreamed of:

"With everyone, and for the good of all"
