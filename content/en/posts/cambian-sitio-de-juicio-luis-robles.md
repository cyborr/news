Havana Cuba. - The trial of the prisoner of conscience Luis Robles Elizástegui, which several days ago was scheduled for the Provincial People's Court of Havana (commonly known as the Hearing of Havana), was suddenly relocated to the Municipal People's Court of Marianao, as reported this Wednesday Robles's lawyer to Landy Fernández Elizástegui, the prisoner's brother.

The process is scheduled for this Thursday, December 16 at 9:00 in the morning.

On December 4, Robles Elizástegui served one year in the Combinado del Este prison, located in the Cuban capital, where he is held without having been tried or convicted after he was imprisoned for exercising his right to freedom of expression. . His trial had previously been scheduled for July 16, 2021, but was suspended following popular protests that took place on the 11th of that month across the country.

Robles Elizástegui, who has just turned 29 years of age, has been the victim during his captivity of constant harassment, physical and psychological torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and other violations of his individual rights by the authorities of the aforementioned Havana prison , where he has spent most of his seclusion.

The young computer scientist and father of a small child was declared a prisoner of conscience by the non-governmental organization Prisoners Defenders at the beginning of January of this year. The Prosecutor's Office asks for a sentence of six years for the alleged crime of enemy propaganda plus one year for the alleged crime of resistance, for a joint penalty of six years in prison.

Luis Robles Elizástegui was arrested on Havana's San Rafael boulevard for displaying a poster in which he asked for freedom and the end of the repression, as well as the release of rapper Denis Solís, who at that time was a prisoner. The young man was able to circulate for a few minutes showing the poster and speaking to passers-by, who filmed him and even expressed their support for him, before being detained by agents of the Police and the Ministry of the Interior.

Just this Wednesday, the Undersecretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs of the United States Department of State, Brian A. Nichols, recalled on Twitter that Robles was facing a prison sentence of up to six years "for peacefully holding a banner supporting the release of Denis Solís. We join the call of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for the Cuban government to release him immediately, ”said the official.

The United States Embassy in Havana also regretted that ** "instead of allowing artists to express themselves peacefully" **, the Cuban government silenced them with prison.
