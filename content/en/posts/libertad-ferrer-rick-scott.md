MIAMI, United States. - Senator Rick Scott (R-F) demanded this Wednesday humanitarian attention for the Cuban opponent José Daniel Ferrer, held for several months in a jail in Santiago de Cuba, and for the hundreds of political prisoners on the island.

Previously, Scott had also had exchanges with the relatives of the leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU).

“Yesterday I spoke with Ana Belkis Ferrer, Luis Enrique Ferrer and Martha Ferrer. These relatives told me that every day José Daniel is subjected to physical and psychological torture by the brutal Cuban communist regime in an attempt to end his life. He suffers from severe headaches, bleeding in the mouth, malnutrition, cough and insomnia, all products of the cruel torture and inhumane treatment of the regime, ”the senator declared.

For Scott, "it is evident that these actions stem from the total fear of the regime for the leadership of José Daniel in the movement for freedom and democracy that is spreading across Cuba."

“The shocking reality is that José Daniel and other innocent people are dying. The United States and our partners around the world must demand humanitarian intervention to save their lives, ”the statement said.

Rick Scott also called on the Biden administration to "work with the UN, OAS and other human rights groups and members of the international community to ensure the immediate release of all freedom activists imprisoned in Cuba."

This morning, the Republican senator had denounced the White House's disinterest in taking sides in the case of Ferrer and the political prisoners in Cuba.

“The White House hung up on me when I called to speak to someone about the horrible torture and abuse against José Daniel Ferrer, who lives as a prisoner of the illegitimate Cuban communist regime. This is not just weakness, it is shameful cowardice. I will not tolerate it, "said Scott on Twitter.

"After the strange incident this morning, I had the pleasure of finally speaking with someone in the White House about the horrible abuses suffered by José Daniel Ferrer and other freedom activists at the hands of the illegitimate Cuban communist regime," said the legislator, who He considered the disagreement over.

“We cannot tolerate further delay and inaction. All those who support freedom, democracy and human rights must stand up, be strong and condemn the crimes against humanity committed by the Diaz-Canel and Castro regime. The Cuban people deserve to free themselves from this tyranny and true democracy where they can live without fear. I really hope that, following these calls, the Biden government and our partners in the fight to protect human rights will take action and unapologetically support José Daniel Ferrer and the brave Cuban people fighting for their freedom.
