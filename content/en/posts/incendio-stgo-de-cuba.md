Nine houses located on San Carlos Street, near Céspedes Park, in Santiago de Cuba, were destroyed by flames during a fire this Thursday morning.

At first, the local newspaper Sierra Maestra reported that five homes had been affected, but the Cuban News Agency (ACN) raised the figure to "nine rooms in a citadel", thereby trying to reduce the magnitude of a disaster that left several families with nothing.

Elio Rodríguez, Mayor of the town, assured that no human losses are reported and the results of the expert investigation are awaited to identify the origin of the fire. Once this happens, the Community Services brigades will collect the rubble and clean the area.

The affected people were taken "to safe places, with the maxim that the Cuban Revolution and the State do not abandon their children." However, although the victims repeat this in front of cameras and official journalists, they are aware that it could bring them a long time in unsanitary shelters.

Being wooden and old installations, the flames spread with great ease and the material losses are enormous, especially for those who saw a lifetime burn in front of them. An optimistic note published by the ACN indicates that "the material damage will be evaluated and the companies and agencies in charge of restoring the homes or any decision will be determined, according to the scale of the damage."

This Thursday there was also a fire at the Etecsa headquarters in Las Tunas that left the province incommunicado and caused partial damage in Camagüey, Granma and Guantánamo.

So far the causes that generated the flames are unknown and work is being done to facilitate telephone communication in the territory where the accident occurred, although a part of the voice and data services has already been recovered, both by landline and mobile networks. In Granma and Guantánamo they have already been reestablished, the company reported Friday.
