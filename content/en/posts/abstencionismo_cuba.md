The final results of the so-called municipal "elections" held this Sunday, November 27 in Cuba, reflected the lowest number of Cubans' participation in an electoral process called by the regime: only 68% of those who had the right to vote did so. they made.

Of the 8,351,311 Cubans who were expected to exercise their right to vote this Sunday, 5,728,220 went to the polling stations, according to Alina Balseiro Gutiérrez, president of the National Electoral Council (CEN).

"5,728,220 Cuban men and women exercised their right to vote, representing 68% in relation to the basic part of 8,351,311 voters. Of the total ballots deposited in the polls, 89.11% were valid," declared the official, from according to a note published on the state website Cubadebate.

Balseiro Gutiérrez added that 5.22% of the deposited ballots were blank and 5.60% were cancelled.

Despite the fact that the president of the CEN triumphantly assured that the results demonstrate popular support for her representatives and confidence in the Revolution, according to the official media note, the level of abstention evidenced in these elections is the highest registered in Cuba since that the regime began to hold elections and referendums.

For decades, the Cuban authorities exhibited percentages of citizen participation in their elections, which exceeded 90%. Already in 2017, there was a lower turnout at the polls in this phase of the regime's "electoral process", when more than 7.2 million Cubans voted, 82.05% of citizens with the possibility of doing so.

The negative trend continued during the 2019 constitutional referendum, when only 84% voted. Last September, during the referendum on the Family Code, only 76% of Cubans went to the polling stations.

The current numbers, with a participation that did not reach 70% of the electoral roll, show the loss of support of the regime and the lack of confidence of Cubans in the electoral process.

As a member of a polling station interviewed by DIARIO DE CUBA had to admit during the day of the elections, the "elections" on the Island have ceased to be "a party."

"This year the security for the elections have been very deficient. To begin with, the voting booths are very poor and rustic, they look like small carnival bathrooms with pieces of wood without any finish and bad sackcloth," complained a member of the table at the Eduardo García Lavandero elementary school, located in the Lawton neighborhood, in the Diez de Octubre municipality.

"The usual summons ballots that help so much to organize the voting did not arrive, and in terms of food security, very bad, not to mention the good lunches that they brought us in boxes to last all day," he added.

"Before, voting was a holiday, the neighbors disputed to be the first to vote. Now we have difficulties even looking for the pioneers to guard the ballot boxes, who came for a while and left," the interviewee concluded wistfully.

The delay of the pioneers was one of the incidences evidenced in some polling stations, according to a note from the state newspaper Granma. Some members of the tables also appeared late at the schools, according to the official media note.

Given the lack of transparency of the regime's electoral system and the obstacles imposed on civil society and citizens who are not related to it, Cubans inside and outside the island promoted a campaign in favor of abstention.

The opposition platform Council for the Democratic Transition in Cuba (CTDC), which tried to present candidates, denounced that only one of the seven it supported, José Antonio Cabrera Parada, managed to be nominated, while six women who wanted to run failed. due to pressure from the regime.

According to the information provided by the CEN and cited by Cubadebate, 11,502 district delegates were elected out of a total of 12,427. Next Sunday, 925 constituencies will go to a second round.
