The rebellious rapper and activist of the political opposition **Carlos Ernesto Díaz González**, better known on social networks as **Ktivo Disidente**, received a sentence of two and a half years in prison for peacefully protesting on the boulevard of San Raphael in Havana.

On April 28, Ktivo Dissidente raised his voice to ask for ** “freedom for the Cuban people” ** assuring that ** “I am not going to live in silence. I do not want to"**. However, these statements, which are completely normal in a democratic country and where freedom of expression is respected as part of human rights, mean crimes that lead to prison in Cuba.

The prosecution requested two and a half years alleging crimes of **"defamation, disobedience and contempt"**. The judge did not hesitate to grant the sentence requested as evidence that the Cuban judicial system is in the hands of the **Communist Party** and its repressive arm, the **Ministry of the Interior (Minint)**.

Currently, Díaz González has been deprived of his liberty in the Ariza prison in the city of Cienfuegos since Minint officials captured him on top of a wall on San Rafael boulevard, where he climbed so that the Cubans could better hear his speech than He asked for changes to build a better society.

The conviction of the Cuban activist has brought numerous reactions on social networks. For example, the jurist Eloy Viera Cañive commented that the ** “trial is a mere procedure to legitimize the suffering that power has caused him due to his irreverence. This makes it more essential that attention be paid to what is happening with him and with hundreds of other political prisoners”**.

**“Prisoners who, for those who sit down to negotiate political solutions for their personal or partisan agendas, are just a number. One that can be easily placed or removed from the table, just as Cuban totalitarianism swallows up and disappears those who oppose it”**, added Viera Cañive.

For its part, the independent organization [Cubalex](https://cubalex.org/) compared the judge's decision with the sentence handed down to the pro-government troubadour Fernando Bécquer. The singer-songwriter “accused by 30 women of abuse, is on the street running errands in Vedado. While today the activist Ktivo Dissidente was sentenced to two and a half years in PRISON for climbing a wall and asking for the release of political prisoners. The priorities”, stated Cubalex.

This is not the first time that the 40-year-old activist has been in the prisons of the Castro dictatorship, in addition to these seven months that he has been held pending trial, he has been deprived of liberty at other times where he starred in several hunger strikes.
