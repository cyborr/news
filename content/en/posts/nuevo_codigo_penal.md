On December 1st, a Penal Code enters into force in Cuba, which, although it is as repressive as the one still in force, has been legally perfected with respect to its predecessor. This shows that the regime does not foresee solutions in the medium or long term for the problems that most burden the population, including housing, nor changes in the way dissent is managed.

Proof of this is that the new Code not only maintains the criminalization of homeless Cubans —mainly single women with children— who enter empty state premises, but also expands the power of the prosecutor to decide when the crime is classified in the case of illegal occupation of privately owned real estate. With the previous Code, it was only criminalized when the occupied property was state-owned.

This, while the Cuban regime continues to fail to comply with its own housing construction plan —without stopping the hotel construction— and without approving a new Housing Law, initially foreseen in the legislative schedule for July 2020.

As Carlos Lima Beltrán recently analyzed in DIARIO DE CUBA, the options left by the regime to homeless people —mostly women with children— are to sleep on the street, have their houses fall on them, or go to jail.

Like the criminalization of poverty, that of dissent is not new in the Penal Code. It existed in the one that is still in force and remains in the one that will be as of December 1. This only reinforces the repressive function that criminal law has in Cuba.

The new code annulled Law No. 93, of December 20, 2001, "Against Acts of Terrorism"; Not so Law 88, relative to the "Protection of the National Independence and the Economy of Cuba" and known as the Gag Law. Criminal Code and Law 88 will coexist and will remain a threat to Cubans who openly disagree with the Government.

The new Cuban Penal Code contains especially dangerous articles for civil society that have already been the subject of an analysis in DIARIO DE CUBA: Article 120, "Arbitrary exercise of constitutional rights and/or liberties," and Article 143, "Other crimes against the security of the State".

Since before the regulation was approved, political police agents have used both articles to threaten opponents, activists and independent journalists with jail, if they do not go into exile or abandon their activities. Both provide for penalties of between four and ten years in prison, and are purely political in nature.

Using them to imprison Cuban dissidents would imply for the regime the recognition that there are political prisoners on the Island, but the truth is that it does not need to spend that bullet, although it will without a doubt, if forced to.

Before resorting to heavy artillery, it has the criminal figure of "public disorder" perfected in Article 263, sections 1 and 3, subsection d) of the new Code, since even Cubans who go to a ministry or institution can be accused to request a dialogue or raise a concern. Thus, the regime prevents population care systems from becoming spaces for popular demand.

Meanwhile, the Demonstration Law, which should regulate this constitutional right, has not yet been approved, so those who protest in the street, even peacefully, will continue to be imprisoned.

On the other hand, before approving —after several postponements— the Law for the Protection of Constitutional Rights, the regime made sure to limit its scope with Article 120 of the new Penal Code, which criminalizes the exercise of the rights recognized in the Constitution, if it considers that they endanger "the constitutional order and the normal functioning of the State and the Cuban Government". The penalty for those who "arbitrarily exercise" these rights is four to ten years in prison.

And if some of those "revolutionaries" who usually follow the regime's calls, like Miguel Díaz-Canel's before the outbreak of the 9/11 protests, feared injuring or even killing a "counterrevolutionary" and going to jail, with this new Penal Code you can completely forget about it.

If Article 4 of the Constitution already recognized supporters of the regime "the right to fight by all means, including armed struggle, when no other recourse is possible, against anyone who tries to overthrow the political, social and economic order established by this Constitution", Article 23.5 of the new Penal Code establishes that "anyone who adequately prevents or repels an imminent or current danger or damage to public peace or to the property or social interests of the State acts in legitimate defense".

If these "revolutionaries" go too far, "the court can reduce the sanction by up to two thirds of its minimum limit"; and if he considers that "this excess has been committed because of excitement or violent emotion causes given for the aggression, can dispense with imposing any sanction", indicates the aforementioned Article.

Be careful: this Article of the Penal Code can be used by the regime to perpetrate and legitimize more extrajudicial executions during citizen protests, such as that of the Cuban Diubis Laurencio Tejeda on July 12, 2021. And the newly murdered could be more uncomfortable citizens for the regime.

That would prevent him from resorting to the death penalty, which, on the other hand, continues in the new Penal Code despite internal and external criticism.

Last May, days before the approval of the new Criminal Code by unanimous vote of the National Assembly of People's Power, the representation of the Cuban regime before the United Nations subordinated the elimination of this punishment to the policy of the United States Government towards Cuba.

"The decision must be linked to the cessation of the policy of hostility and aggression practiced against Cuba by the Government of the United States, so that Cuba can advance in its economic, political and social development, with full guarantees of respect for its sovereignty. ", affirmed the delegation of the regime, during the 73 Session of the Committee against Torture.

The Cuban regime's respect for the right to life of its citizens depends on US policy. The Cubans are hostages, used to achieve the removal of the embargo and the removal of the Cuban state from the list of sponsors of terrorism.

In fact, the regime increased by four the number of crimes for which the death penalty can be applied as punishment. If in the Penal Code still in force there were 20, the one that will enter into force on December 1 contains 24.

The death penalty is criticized by religious sectors and civil society, inside and outside Cuba, because it violates the first and main human right of every person, life, and because it allows the State to legally murder a citizen.

As we already explained last October, in Cuba, where only one political party is legal, the economic, political and economic model is irreversible, according to the Constitution, and trying to change it is illegal, the death penalty allows the regime to physically eliminate its adversaries legally or, at a minimum, use their right to life to negotiate in the international arena.

The four crimes punishable with the maximum penalty added to the new Penal Code are crimes against the security of the State. Of the 24 total that can be sanctioned with the maximum penalty, more than half are crimes of this nature.
